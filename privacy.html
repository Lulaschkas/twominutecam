            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary
                and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the
                services offered there.</p>
            <p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter
                referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection,
                recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,
                disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination,
                restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>
            <p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose,
                duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction
                with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and
                improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and
                control.</p>
            <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
            <h3>I. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
            <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the
                right</p>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being
                    processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also
                    Art. 15 GDPR);</li>
                <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
                <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if
                    further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per
                    Art. 18 GDPR;</li>
                <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted
                    to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
                <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being
                    processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such
                corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR.
                However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate
                effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
            <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller's
                    future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to
                    data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>
            <h3>II. Information about the data processing</h3>
            <p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage
                ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or
                unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>
            <h4>Server data</h4>
                    <p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser to us or to our server provider will
                be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and
                version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you came (referrer URL), the webpages on
                our site visited, the date and time of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our
                site.</p>

            <p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>
            <p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement,
                stability, functionality, and security of our website.</p>

                Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland (hereinafter: Google).</p>
            <p>To enable the display of certain fonts on our website, a connection to the Google server in the USA is

            <p>The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the optimization and economic
                operation of our site.</p>
            <p>When you access our site, a connection to Google is established from which Google can identify the site from

            <p>in particular on options for preventing the use of data.</p>
            <h4>FontAwesome</h4>
            <p>In order to be able to display fonts and visual elements of our website, we use FontAwesomeâ€™s external
                fonts.&nbsp; FontAwesome is a service of</p>
            <p>Fonticons Inc., 6 Porter Road, Apartment 3R, Cambridge, MA 02140, USA, hereinafter referred to as
                "FontAwesome".</p>
            <p>When you access our website, a connection is established to the FontAwesome server in the USA in order to
                enable and update the display of fonts and visual elements.</p>
            <p>The legal basis is Art.&nbsp; 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the optimisation and

                website your request was sent and to which IP address the font should be sent.</p>

            <p>FontAwesome offers further information, in particular on the options for preventing data use.</p>
            <h4>YouTube</h4>
            <p>We use YouTube on our website. This is a video portal operated by YouTube LLC, 901 Cherry Ave, 94066 San
                Bruno, CA, USA, hereinafter referred to as "YouTube".</p>
            <p>YouTube is a subsidiary of Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Irland, hereinafter
                referred to as "Google".</p>
            <p>We use YouTube in its advanced privacy mode to show you videos. The legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f)
                GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in improving the quality of our website. According to YouTube, the
                advanced privacy mode means that the data specified below will only be transmitted to the YouTube server if
                you actually start a video.</p>
            <p>Without this mode, a connection to the YouTube server in the USA will be established as soon as you access
                any of our webpages on which a YouTube video is embedded.</p>
            <p>This connection is required in order to be able to display the respective video on our website within your
                browser. YouTube will record and process at a minimum your IP address, the date and time the video was
                displayed, as well as the website you visited. In addition, a connection to the DoubleClick advertising
                network of Google is established.</p>
            <p>If you are logged in to YouTube when you access our site, YouTube will assign the connection information to
                your YouTube account. To prevent this, you must either log out of YouTube before visiting our site or make
                the appropriate settings in your YouTube account.</p>
            <p>For the purpose of functionality and analysis of usage behavior, YouTube permanently stores cookies on your
                device via your browser. If you do not agree to this processing, you have the option of preventing the
                installation of cookies by making the appropriate settings in your browser. Further details can be found in
                the section about cookies above.</p>

            <h4>jsdelivr.net-CDN</h4>
            <p>We use the service jsdeliver.com, a content delivery network ("CDN"), on our website to optimise the
                retrieval speed, the design and presentation of the content of our website on different devices.&nbsp; This
                is an open source service provided by Prospectone Sp.z.o.o., ul. Krolweska 65A, 30-081, Cracow, Poland.</p>
            <p>In order to be able to deliver the content of our website quickly, the service uses so-called JavaScript
                libraries.&nbsp; Corresponding files are loaded from a third-party server that records your IP
                address.&nbsp; We have no influence on whether your IP address is processed by third parties for statistical
                purposes.</p>

                times and protecting our website, as well as in analysing and optimising our website.</p>
            <p>To completely prevent jsdeliver.net from executing the JavaScript code, you can install a so-called
                JavaScript blocker, such as noscript.net or ghostery.com. If you were to prevent or restrict the execution
                of the Java Script code, this can mean that for technical reasons not all the content and functions of our
                website may be available.</p>
